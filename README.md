# Snake Game<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  This is a re-creation of the Snake Game (built with Python) where the "snake" is controlled using the keyboard directional keys and is steered to eat food that is randomly generated on the screen.  As food is eaten the snake grows and the player must keep the snake within the bounds of the screen and avoid collisions with itself.
